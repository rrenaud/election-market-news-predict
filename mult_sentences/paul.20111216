Earlier this year, President Obama hit on a similar theme, offering a counter-proposal to Paul Ryan’s draconian budget: “If we believe the government can make a difference in people's lives, we have the obligation to prove that it works — by making government smarter, and leaner and more effective.” He’s also suggested significant government reorganization efforts (as many have before, granted).

Even as the Texas gadfly grew shrill in his exasperation with the bomb-bomb-bomb, bomb-bomb-Iran rhetoric from his Republican rivals, Paul was clear in how he would respond to ambiguous intelligence estimates: "I would say that the greatest danger is over-reacting."

And even Ron Paul, who has a questionable social conservative record … he’s even talking about social issues in the state of Iowa,” he said.
Two other polls show Paul, a libertarian Republican congressman, moving into second place behind Gingrich in Iowa and gunning for an upset that would almost certainly help Romney by stopping Gingrich's rise.

The challenge isn't all that great ... he's beating himself," Paul said.
Texas Rep. Ron Paul was also the victim of a Bachmann barrage, as he defended his position of America stepping back or eliminating altogether its military presence around the world.
Paul is too old and too isolationist for the Military industrial complex represented in large part by the GOP.They scorn his Iran "policy"
Rick Perry may have had a lot riding on the last debate before the Iowa caucuses, but U.S. Rep. Ron Paul stole the show Thursday night in Sioux City.
I believe in very little anymore but the one thing I absolutely believe is that Ron Paul will bring us back from the brink of catastrophe.
“To me the greatest danger is that we will have a president that will overreact, that we will soon bomb Iran,” Paul said.
As for that first tier, Romney seemed to play it safe tonight, Paul went a little crazy on Iran and probably helped limit his further upside growth, and Gingrich managed at once to get clobbered by Bachmann on Freddie Mac and do very well for much of the rest of the debate.

Speaking of Paul, he and Michele Bachmann provided some of the debate's most electrifying moments.
Consider this: At a time when Olympia Snowe or Susan Collins is hesitant to partner with the White House on any kind of legislation, specifically health care, here comes Ron Wyden embracing Paul Ryan.
News that even though Bachmann pulled ahead of the pack in the Aug. 13 Ames Straw Poll, her current New York Times/CBS News Iowa polling numbers place her at only 9 percent, which positions Gingrich, Romney, Paul and Perry in front of her.

@V1,....guess what toots,....I'm a retired 65 year old Ron Paul
Dr. Paul would probably not give that man water while on the governments time but would surely do so on his own time.
Paul moved up the polls when many of the other candidates canceled themselves out by crazy ideas or quotes.
As he is in the race, the wildcard of the night was Ron Paul.
In the strictest sense, Paul has the political philosophy that
Ron Paul supporters like to smell little boys underwear.
Paul was right and that idiot Bachmann was wrong about what the report
Tonight's Fox News debate was, unbelievably enough, the final one before the Iowa's first-in-the-nation primary contest on January 3, but it's unclear whether any of the race's leading candidates — Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Newt Gingrich — managed to distinguish themselves from the rest of the field.
Ron paul … oh wait he wasn’t on the glorious partisan ballot and we all
But the Iowa results will winnow that field, and Paul's standing on Jan. 3 is likely to deny a solid finish to someone with better prospects for winning the nomination.
Paul has always preached non-interventionism, but it hasn’t been featured so prominently in any other debate.
"We have endured a disproportionate amount of bad writing about our state from journalists who don't know very much about the place, and I for one can't bear to suffer through another campaign of it," Paul wrote, in an August column addressed to the hordes of journalists soon to be clogging the taxi stand at the Austin airport.
Paul, his voice rising, said he "obviously" does not want Iran to become a nuclear power, but he said that to "declare war on 1.2 billion Muslims" is "dangerous talk."
Also participating in the debate were Texas Rep. Ron Paul, Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann, Texas Gov.
As I noted last night, the sparring between Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul over the question of a nuclear Iran stood out in last night’s Iowa Republican debate.

Ron Paul also is going after Gingrich on television, and Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum have sharpened their criticism.

Paul told Fox News moderators that he was unique in the crowded Republican field.

A Ron Paul charge would likely help Romney, who could use any help to cease Newt Gingrich's momentum.
This time, Paul s populist, libertarian message is resonating with voters across the political spectrum who are nervous about the economy and fed up with Wall Street bankers and Washington power brokers alike.
"The main problem we have is the government is too big and the debt is too big and you have to cut spending so you have to get people to come together," Paul said.
Paul continued his attacks on front-runner Newt Gingrich for his involvement with Freddie Mac.

Paul cited himself as a candidate with “an American philosophy” who could bring Independents and even Democrats along to vote for him.
But Team Perry hopes that Paul's dogged doveishness, particularly on the issue of a nuclear Iran, is a bridge too far for Iowans.
"I think he is wisely backing off on the sanctions," Paul said, warning of the effects sanctions on Iran could have on Europe.
The best aspect of the debate was that no one, with the exception of Paul and Bachmann, had a meltdown.

Ron Paul, the renegade Republican with libertarian leanings, is once again refusing to rule out an independent or third-party candidacy, if he does not win the GOP presidential nomination.

Kentucky’s Sen. Rand Paul agrees, as do a number of other Republican politicians and pundits who find him unfocused, erratic.

(CNN) – When Rep. Michele Bachmann said that a report by the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency had described Iran as poised to join the world's elite club of nuclear powers, during Thursday's Republican candidates' debate in Sioux City, Iowa, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas responded immediately that she was mistaken.

“I think really the question is, is what do we have to offer?” Paul said during Thursday night’s Republican presidential debate in Iowa, after he was asked if he would support the eventual GOP nominee.
Where Paul had talked about the danger of overreacting on Iran, she said it "would be that the greatest underreaction in world history if we have an avowed madman who uses that nuclear weapon to wipe nations off the face of the Earth and we have an IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] report that recently came out that said literally, Iran is within just months from being able to obtain that weapon."

Gingrich also called Ryan's plan "too big a jump" when Gregory sought to clarify that Gingrich did not support "what Paul Ryan is suggesting."
