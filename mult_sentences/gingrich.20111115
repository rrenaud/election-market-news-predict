Gingrich lugs loads of personal, political baggage | 19 days ago by NANCY BENAC, Associated Press Associated Press Copyright 2011 The Associated Press.
Gingrich is brilliant but soulless, Romney meets the qualifications on paper, at least but is slicker than a Yugo salesman saying it's just like a Jaguar and the others are the equivalent of the three stooges or the Marx Bros. Hunstman is the only one I see as being truly qualified so that puts him out of the running for the nomination.
Which is why condescension, sometimes mixed with pity, has become Gingrich's signature look.
During the Nov. 9 debate sponsored by CNBC, Gingrich was asked what he did to earn the $300,000 consultant’s fee with Freddie Mac.
"My advice as a historian, when they walked in and said to me, 'We are now making loans to people who have no credit history and have no record of paying back anything, but that's what the government wants us to do' I said to them at the time, 'This is a bubble, this is insane, this is impossible,' " Gingrich said at last week's debate.

But it’s no small catch by Bloomberg’s Clea Benson, who made some calls to find out what exactly Gingrich actually told Freddie at the time.
Media accounts in 1999 said Freddie Mac first hired Gingrich that spring when he had just left Congress.
