* Former Utah governor Jon Huntsman today embraced denialism about climate change, alluding to “debate” and “questions about the validity of the science.” While Huntsman has long argued that nothing can be done about global warming in this economy, he did not previously question its existence, so this is something of a shift.
But in a late August interview on ABC's This Week, Huntsman was extremely critical of his party’s stance on climate change, calling it a “losing position.”
