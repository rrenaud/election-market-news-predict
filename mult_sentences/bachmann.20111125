(CNN) – Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann announced the support of 39 Iowa party activists Friday as she continues to focus her energies in the first-in-the-nation caucus state.
Michele Bachmann calls herself an “accidental politician,” someone who never dreamed of being in the White House, but someone who finds herself on the presidential campaign trail as a result of her core convictions that began to take shape during her childhood years in Iowa.

In this image released by NBC, Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, of Minnesota, left, points to a photo of host Jimmy Fallon, dressed as Bachmann, during a visit to "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon," that aired early Tuesday, Nov. 22, 2011 in New York.

Asked which side of this debate she favored, Michele Bachmann said she was "with the American people."
Campaign spokeswoman Alice Stewart said Bachmann has accepted the apologies.
