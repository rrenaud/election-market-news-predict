One could speculate that Trump is no longer moderating the Newsmax debate because only Gingrich and Santorum have agreed to attend, and several high profile candidates — like Mitt Romney, Ron Paul, and Jon Huntsman — explicitly declined to be a part of The Celebrity Apprentice: Iowa Edition.
Gingrich later said, “Ambassador Huntsman knows far more about China than I do.”
Both held forth at enormous length about various issues of great importance in foreign policy, on which their areas of agreement were vast and their areas of disagreement — on Afghanistan, for instance, where Huntsman favors a more-rapid withdrawal of U.S. troops than the Obama administration is pursuing, and Gingrich, well, does not — minimal.

Huntsman panders to the liberals, and basically insults Republican voters as too stupid to vote for a smart guy like him.
Gingrich advocated forcing Iran to dismantle its nuclear weapons program -- "we're ideally going to do it non-militarily, but we are not going to tolerate an Iranian nuclear weapon" -- while Huntsman warned that additional sanctions on Iran "won't work because the mullahs in Tehran have already decided they want to go nuclear."
Huntsman was asked afterwards why he didn't take on Gingrich in some of his more pointed comments.
Huntsman punted on the question, but emphatically declared: “The people are getting screwed.”
