Herman Cain’s sexual harassment scandal is an unwelcome distraction that he needs to address, fellow Republican candidate Jon Huntsman, the former governor of Utah, said in an ABC News/Yahoo interview today.

Florida Republican commentator and consultant Chris Ingram said Huntsman's conservative bonafides outweigh his transgressions: initial support for a cap-and-trade global-warming initiative, a moderate stance on immigration and the fact he was tapped by Barack Obama to be the nation's ambassador to China.
“I’m getting a little whiplash in the race watching everybody go up and down,” Huntsman said.
But Huntsman's campaign tacked to center as the rest of the party moved to the right, and instead of rising in the polls, barely registered in them.
By Erickson's lights, Huntsman is more reliable and substantively conservative -- he even has the best position on taxes, job growth, and deficit reduction -- yet he is still said to be "running as the liberal in the race."
Huntsman, who until earlier this year served as U.S. amabassador to China under President Obama, also stressed his conservative positions in the past.
As conservative groups plot to take down Romney — fearing he will abandon Republican principles in the White House — a Huntsman second-look would be the continuation of the months-long anti-Romney boom-bust cycle.
