In the end, Gingrich emerged where he started—under sharp attack from his rivals and under increasing scrutiny by the media as he tries to maintain his position as the GOP front-runner.
SIOUX CITY, Iowa (CNN) -- Republican presidential frontrunner Newt Gingrich, who has come under assault from nearly all of his rivals for the GOP nomination, defended himself Thursday against questions about his electability and conservative record.
Haley's endorsement is something of a coup for Romney, who is widely distrusted among conservative voters and who has had to contend with a huge surge by Gingrich in recent weeks, because she was elected governor last year with strong Tea Party support.
Gingrich was on the defensive for the first and otherwise-sleepy hour of the forum, as his rivals — save for Romney — pounded him over his contract with housing giant Freddie Mac.
The clash underscored the state of the race, with Gingrich, the former House speaker, atop the polls in Iowa and nationally, while Texas Rep. Ron Paul, former Massachusetts Gov.
New polls suggest that in Iowa, at least, we have already passed peak Gingrich.
In debates, Gingrich said, “Barack Obama will not have a leg to stand on.”
And I don't think Michele Bachmann was saying that the problem with Gingrich taking the money from Freddie Mac was that he was only pretending to be their friend and then selling them out later.
Thursday’s debate came in a week in which the tone of the campaign has turned more negative, with most of the attacks aimed at Gingrich and at a point when personal campaigning and television commercials in Iowa are beginning to play a larger role.
Two other polls show Paul, a libertarian Republican congressman, moving into second place behind Gingrich in Iowa and gunning for an upset that would almost certainly help Romney by stopping Gingrich's rise.
“I would not view a Gingrich campaign as a death knell for the Republican Party in the Northeast.”
The debate's tone was somewhat gentler than the Iowa debate five days earlier, when Gingrich was a freshly minted poll front-runner targeted relentlessly by his rivals.

“Newt’s been reaching out to Hispanic voters for many years,” Garcia, who has been working for Gingrich on Latino issues for seven years, told TheDC.
Gingrich says no regrets to Freddie Mac, but does regret the hit at Mitt: “I don’t regret taking the job because it was a totally legal, non-lobbying, strategic-advisory thing and, you know, I’m not going to go through life, trying, that part just gets mischaracterized.

"I think what it means if he were elected president is that he would endorse efforts already underway to exclude Sharia as well as other non-American law codes from being applied in American courts," said Daniel Pipes, founder of the Middle East Forum, adding that Gingrich's American Enterprise Institute speech was "groundbreaking."
