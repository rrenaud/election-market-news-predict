sponsored by Harkin: Gingrich nomination would be “death wish” for GOP William Petroski 2:52 PM, Dec 8, 2011 Categories: Caucus Insider William Petroski
Newt Gingrich is just another in a long list of unconvincing GOP "front-runners" for president.
Romney will now be asked whether he agrees with Sununu that Gingrich doesn’t have the necessary restraint to be commander in chief and he’ll need to decide whether he backs up his surrogate or seeks to downplay the attack.

Romney, a former venture capitalist and ex-governor of Massachusetts, said Gingrich is "a good man" but made sure to refer to him as "Speaker Gingrich," a reference to his service as speaker of the House of Representatives in the 1990s, one of the ultimate insiders in the capital.
Underscoring the extent to which Newt Gingrich has emerged as a viable candidate in the Republican primary, former Massachusetts Gov.
Gingrich said as a military child, he learned how to travel constantly.
That narrative was front and center again this week as Gingrich explained his remarks to reporters gathered at a New York press conference, emphasizing that
He is by no means a perfect candidate or politician (as much as we want our politicians to be infallible, they never are), but he is light-years less controversial than Gingrich.
Ayres says he doesn't think Gingrich's surge will last, but not for reasons of likeability.
As for the other swing states in this newest poll, Florida and Pennsylvania Republicans favor Gingrich by wide margins as well.

Gingrich denies that account, but more to the point, this gives Gingrich an opportunity to remind Republican voters that he rebelled against Bush Sr.'s budget deal, which included tax increases.
Newt Gingrich has a lot to say about how to fix America's economic problems, suggesting everything from employing schoolchildren as janitors to adhering to the somewhat wonky "Lean Six Sigma" business management philosophy.
Gingrich's quick rise in national and early-state polls
"The negative publicity that will get him—in the sense that he'll be constantly running away—and the fact that it gives me the advantage of always being the guy with the answer," Gingrich said, "I suspect at some point he'll decide it's easier just to agree to debate me."
When Obama did just that later in the month, Gingrich said intervention was a mistake.
There would be so many targets of opportunity to undo the mercurial Gingrich, who once said Medicare should be allowed to “wither and die on the vine,” the kind of hyperbole he is famous for.
