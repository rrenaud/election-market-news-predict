ATLANTA — Embattled presidential candidate Herman Cain told staffers Tuesday that he's reassessing his campaign a day after an Atlanta businesswoman alleged a 13-year extramarital affair with the Republican.
"I don't think that Congressman [Anthony] Weiner's time was any easier or harder than Herman Cain's at this moment," Steele said.

When reports of past sexual harassment claims first surfaced in Politico last month, Cain's campaign appeared unaffected -- and perhaps even benefitted from a rallying of support amongst his most committed backers.
