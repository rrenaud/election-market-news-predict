NEW YORK, Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Drummer Ahmir Thompson says he meant to be funny, not mean, when he played "Lyin' Ass Bitch" during Michele Bachmann's visit to "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon."
GOP Presidential candidate Michele Bachmann received an apology from an NBC executive after an off-color song was played during her appearance on Jimmy Fallon's "Late Night," her spokeswoman said late Wednesday.
The song begins with a distinctive "la la la la la la la la la" refrain - the only words audible before Bachmann, smiling and waving to the audience, sat down.
Bachmann, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in response that you "have to recognize what's happening on the ground."
