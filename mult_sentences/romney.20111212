The Democratic National Committee is already seizing on the comment as proof that Romney is out of touch.
Romney said he differed with Gingrich on easing capital gain tax burdens, on spending federal money for a lunar colony to mine minerals from the moon and his record as a private-sector job creator versus the former speaker's record as a career politician.

(AP) Trading accusations of greed, Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich challenged each other Monday to return millions made in private business as the race for the GOP presidential nomination turned increasingly acerbic and personal at the start of a three-week sprint to the Iowa caucuses.
Asked whether some of his outspoken surrogates - some of whom have referred to Gingrich as "untrustworthy" Romney said he wouldn't distance himself from the critiques but that he did not write the scripts for Gingrich's outspoken opponents.
Gingrich, who has maintained he will run a persistently positive campaign, took a swing at Romney at an earlier appearance in Londonderry, betting $10 the former governor would not return the money he'd made at his venture capital firm.
Romney's a pretty awkward guy at times but not at all here.

To his credit, Romney respectfully disagreed with the man, he did not insult him, nor get peevish.
After the debate, Romney spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom likened the exchange to an argument that people have where one person backs up a position he feels strongly about with a financial wager.
And yet, according to contemporaneous photos, Romney somehow managed to continue looking like someone who smells fantastic.
I don't like excessive regulation, but I like modern updated streamlined regulation that encourages markets to work," Romney explained.
"That would make him the highest paid historian in history," Romney told Fox News Channel during an interview from the Chez Vachon diner, a regular New Hampshire stop for presidential candidates.
