In the wake of some verbal gaffes this week by Perry in New Hampshire, in which he said the voting age is 21 instead of 18 and the presidential election will be on Nov. 12^th instead of Nob.
Mitt Romney, launched a new ad in Iowa, Perry also began airing a new 30-second spot in that key caucus state that casts him as a Washington “outsider” and blames President Obama for U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
Democratic National Committee Chair Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz criticized GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry for suggesting that his foreign aid budget would start at zero - though Perry added that "my bet is that we would be funding them at some substantial level."
It took Perry three months to go from 3 percent in the Real Clear Politics Average to 30 percent.
The ad was paired with Perry's appearance Thursday on NBC's "The Tonight Show."
Perry also criticized the Obama administration's Afghanistan policy by advocating completing the mission in that country and not telegraphing when the United States would withdraw forces.
Matches up with the rest of the clowns: Ninny Perry, the Hermanator Cain (the thoughts are twirling around in his head), Michelle (Let em eat cake) Bachmann (with millions out of work she thinks anyone not working shouldn't eat), Flippety Flop Romney, Huntsman using his daughters to rap for him from Salt Lake City, etc.
Unless Gingrich crashes like Bachmann, Cain and Perry before him, his challenge to Romney could set up a classic electability dilemma for Republicans.
Morrow, like Jones, believes President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary had opponents murdered in Arkansas, George H. W. Bush was a cocaine smuggler, 911 was an inside job, and, in general, nobody is up to no good, especially Rick Perry, who Morrow says is sitting on a "slut fueled tank of nitroglycerin" that will destroy his image.
Of course, Florida - like South Carolina and Iowa - appears susceptible to the GOP’s “flavor of the moment” race to this point: Rick Perry and Herman Cain also had massive bumps in their poll numbers in all three states only to fall back to Earth as their campaigns faltered.
Later that evening at a rally in Houston with former presidential candidate John Edwards, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party tried to turn the Perry apocrypha into a political advantage.
“The Department of Energy,” says Perry in the ad.
With the eclipse of former front-runners Rick Perry and Herman Cain, Gingrich has emerged as the only viable alternative to Romney.
Perry's original mistake was relatively inconsequential-- we've all gotten our dates mixed up, haven't we?

“If you pass into law a right-to-work law, you may join my home state and take over the title of the state that’s creating more jobs in American than any place in the country,” Perry said to the legislature.
Seemingly unaware of his second error, Perry repeated the question back to Leno.
Rick Perry said that climate change was a theory that “still has not been proven” and was driven in part by a “substantial number of scientists who have manipulated data” to secure research grants.
