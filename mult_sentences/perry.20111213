In recent days, both front-runner Newt Gingrich and Texas Governor Rick Perry have touted their respective “optional flat tax” plans as an easy solution to a complicated tax system.

Rick Perry during last Saturday's debate in Iowa, Axelrod said, "Generally his practices have been to bet other people's money, not his own."

Also, if Perry's job required physical labor, Mindard said he would not be able to return to work for six months, which would be Jan. 1, 2012.
That's roughly 50% more than the $570 billion that Perry's plan would boost the deficit vs. current policy, the tax center said.

Though Perry described his surgery as a “fusion,” a common procedure, in August news sources revealed that he had undergone an experimental procedure in which adult stem cells were injected into his back.
