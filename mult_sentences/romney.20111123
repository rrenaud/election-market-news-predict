And in New Hampshire, Romney is running like a front-runner.
Romney argued that President Obama was moving too rapidly to bring out U.S. troops and said he favored maintaining a substantial presence for several more years.
But it was a good night for Romney in the sense that the other candidates, as they so often have in the past, again refrained from taking him on.
"With those two things at stake, looking down the road at a Greece-type situation, or …gutting of our military, our president decided to go campaigning, go around the world making visits, finding people to blame," Romney said.
Ron Paul's exchanges with Gingrich and Romney highlighted a debate which rages, in a different form, among Democrats as well: are we still "at war;" what does that mean; who is it legitimate to put under extra scrutiny and what means - from profiling all the way to torture, as Senator Ayotte and others have suggested - are appropriate against them?
