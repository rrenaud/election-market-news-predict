At the Republican presidential debate in Des Moines, Iowa Saturday, Mitt Romney bet Rick Perry $10,000 on stage that he was wrong when Perry said that Romney supported an federal individual mandate to buy health care in his book, No Apology.
Perry accused Romney of supporting the individual mandate before being against it, and including it in an earlier version of his book before removing it.
Here in Iowa, the Perry campaign is airing a television ad titled “Strong” which attacks President Obama’s “war on religion” while also criticizing the ability of gay soldiers to serve openly in the military.
Perry contended Romney went so far as to revise a book he wrote to change his position on the federal mandate — a claim Romney challenged and wanted to back it up with a $10,000 bet.
But Romney may have hurt himself by challenging Texas Governor Rick Perry to a $10,000 bet over healthcare in a quip that drew criticism of Romney as out of touch with normal Americans in economic hard times.
At another point in the meeting, Perry mistakenly said there were eight Supreme Court justices instead of nine, the report said.
Perry had accused Romney of removing language that expressed support for the individual mandate from the second edition of Romney’s book, ‘No Apology: The Case for America’s Greatness.’ Romney assured Perry his opposition to the mandate has been consistent, and bet him $10,000 that no incriminating language had been removed.
The nation needs lower taxes, less regulation and more common sense, he said, "and an outsider like Rick Perry is going to do that."
