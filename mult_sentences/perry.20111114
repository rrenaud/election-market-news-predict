The "they" are the Republican presidential candidates -- which include Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Rick Perry, and Rick Santorum -- who signaled their support of waterboarding as an interrogation technique during the primary debate this weekend, according to CBS News, with Bachman and Cain explicitly saying they'd bring it back as an interrogation technique if president.
The Weekly Standard was dismayed in early September, when Jon Huntsman "sounded more like President Obama than the previous Republican president of the United States" -- and Rick Perry agreed with him.
It starts showing a picture of Perry over the words, "You've heard about the 53 seconds that supposedly ended a presidential campaign," followed by another screen showing the president over the line, "How about the 53 seconds that should end a presidency?"

Perry was at 5 percent in the poll – down from 37 percent in August.
Perry's debate blunder last Wednesday, when he struggled to name the third of three government departments he would eliminate as president, has damaged his campaign but he remains in contention, the poll shows.
Burnett was discussing the matter with campaign veteran James Carville, and noted that she did not think Cain knew as much about Libya as he seemed to give away in the clip (nothing), but merely that the campaign “is taking a real toll on him.” While Carville agreed that campaigns are “utterly exhausting, you have no idea what it’s like,” he couldn’t help but note that it was a “painful” moment that “made Rick Perry look like Henry Kissinger.”

AP: Perry Requested Billions in Federal Aid as Governor
Rick Perry, Rep. Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain favor bringing back waterboarding, as they unashamedly noted in Saturday's GOP debate.
This, after both candidates have been in damage control mode - Rick Perry for his debate gaffe and Herman Cain for sexual harassment allegations.
Vice presidential candidates also have “stepped in it,” as Perry characterized his debate performance yesterday on NBC’s “Today” program.
After last week's debate flub of forgetting one of the departments he'd eliminate if elected president, Perry lost half his support.
And the tension between the two camps has propelled the most unlikely of candidates to the top — first Michelle Bachmann, then Rick Perry, then Herman Cain, and now, maybe, Newt Gingrich.
Seventy-three percent of Cain’s supporters hold a favorable view of Gingrich, PPP points out, while both Romney and Perry have negative net favorability ratings among Cain’s supporters.
Rick Perry is seen defending a Texas policy that granted in-state tuition to children of illegal immigrants, saying those who oppose it “don’t have a heart.” And Newt Gingrich is shown sitting side by side with then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi — a favorite target of conservative scorn — in a 2008 climate change awareness ad.

Rick Perry criticizes the Federal Reserve, calling it “almost treacherous—or treasonous in my opinion” for “printing money to play politics.” He claims this while at the same time benefitting immensely from his super political action committee “Make American Great Again.”
As for Rick Perry, he didn't mind his flub the other night, but still doesn't want him to be President.
Perry registered 31 percent and headed the GOP field in September.  By October, after several so-so debate performances, the Texas governor was down to 14 percent.  In PPP’s latest survey, his support registers at just 6 percent.
