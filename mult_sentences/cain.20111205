In the Republican corner, Newt Gingrich seems to be leading positive image polls, followed closely by Herman Cain and in third, Mitt Romney.

Cain by comparison maintained her indefinitely, kept helping her financially even long after this supposed affair.
"The fact is these anonymous allegations are false and now the Democrat machine in America has brought forth a troubled woman to make these accusations," said Cain.
Cain, who had lead polls at one point in the race, saw his support among conservatives erode over the last few weeks due to allegations of sexual harassment and a woman claiming a 13-year-long affair with the married former CEO of Godfather's Pizza.
