GOP presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are battling for the lead as they approach the Iowa caucuses in 2012.
Though Gingrich, like Romney, has held non-conservative positions, voters find him more authentic because he engineered the Republican House takeover in 1994, while Romney has no base conservative record from which to deviate.
Ron Paul released a web video yesterday that accused Newt Gingrich, now challenging Romney for frontrunner status, of rank hypocrisy.
For all of his faults, Newt Gingrich has much more experience doing the job, as opposed to Romney, who has much more experience at trying to get the job.
I must admit that Newt has had a very extensive, long record of working in Washington with various governmental and non-governmental agencies, and I just don t think that s the background that s ideally suited, one, to replace (President) Barack Obama, and number two, to lead the country, Romney said.
"Mitt Romney has taken on significant challenges at every moment in his life.
Unlike many other self-aggrandizing pronouncements by the former House speaker, that one, sadly, had an element of truth, as Romney's campaign promptly proved.

Unlike other Republican challengers, whom Romney strategists regarded as too conservative or lacking the gravitas needed to beat the former Massachusetts governor's well-financed and well-organized campaign, Gingrich presents a potentially lethal challenge.

Unlike other competitors who have briefly vied for the hearts of conservatives and the role of “anti-Romney,’’ Gingrich seems to have survived initial rounds of critical reviews and is using his experience gained in winning and losing the speakership to take on Romney.
But he continued to support the general idea of letting illegal immigrants apply for citizenship or legal residency — a policy that the Romney of 2011 presumably would condemn as "amnesty."
All that opens the way for Romney to employ a strategy he used as other, more conservative alternatives to him have risen and fallen over the past six months.
On the other hand, Romney clearly sees Perry as a threat to his campaign, as evidenced by his constant attacks on the Texas governor.
And Romney will be asked about his record and his perceived shifts on a variety of issues ad nauseum.

Among those who do consider themselves to be members of the Tea Party, he's winning by 37 points — 47 to 10 percent (over Romney and Herman Cain).
His campaign is waiting for other candidates to engage Mr. Gingrich, but if voters have not turned from Mr. Gingrich in the next two weeks, Mr. Romney is prepared to pounce.
