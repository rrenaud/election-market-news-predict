As far as straw polls go, Ron Paul just one the Pasco County straw poll here in Florida with an overwhelming majority of the vote 171 to Gingrich's 51.
But assuming that the Evangelical vote remains splintered among them, it is Paul who would be helped most of all — since that would drain support from Gingrich, do nothing to help Romney (whose hard ceiling is presumed to be somewhere south of the 25 percent he amassed in 2008), and do nothing to hurt Paul, whose combination of money, organization, and die-hard support is causing many of those same Iowa sharpies to start calling him (quietly) the favorite to win the caucuses.

Romney and Paul, on the other hand, may be handicapped by the current skew in their support from younger voters and independents who lean Republican -- groups that don't currently appear to be as interested in the election.
If it's isolationism you don't like, then stay away from THEM, not Ron Paul.
Romney leads among young Republicans, aged 18 to 34, but, at 26%, is only slightly ahead of Gingrich and Ron Paul among this group, with both receiving close to 20%.
Wallace, who has caught some flak for his recent comments on Ron Paul, took a few serious moments to say that he stood by his feeling that a Paul win in the Iowa caucus diminishes the relevancy of the event.
And still another candidate, Ron Paul, finished a close second in Ames and, according to most prognosticators, is now in a better position than Bachmann, Perry and Romney in the race for Iowa, to say nothing of Cain, who has suspended his campaign.
He still leads Mitt Romney (18) and Ron Paul (16.7).
