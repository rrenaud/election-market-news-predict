Yet with just under three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses and the evangelical vote that buoyed Mike Huckabee’s win here four years ago still up for grabs, Perry kicked off his 14-day, 44-city bus tour with a speech that invoked the importance of “values” nine times in 20 minutes.

Today, the Bachmann and Perry campaigns are leaking internal polling that has Newt stalled (if you can believe those campaigns)…and the meaningless national tracking polls have Newt stuck around 33% or so.
But Christy Hoppe of The Dallas Morning News was there and caught something more important, which is that Perry said, "We got to get the government out of deciding everything — picking winners and losers."
Perry's making an overt pitch to Christian conservatives, much more direct than Mike Huckabee did four years ago, when his ad raised questions about whether background lighting on a bookshelf suggested the shape of a cross.
