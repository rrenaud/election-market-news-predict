In addition to Gingrich and Romney, the debate will include Representative Michele Bachmann, Representative Ron Paul, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and former Senator Rick Santorum.

Barney Frank arrested and thinks same-sex marriage is a “ temporary aberration.” And yet it appears many in the media are willing to dismiss some of Newt Gingrich‘s wildest ideas, focusing instead on his personal shortcomings and general unpleasantness, letting Gingrich-backing Republicans get away with the bizarre meme that Gingrich deserves to be considered a member of the Republican “smart set.”
