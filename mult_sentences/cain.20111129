ATLANTA (AP) -- Herman Cain told aides today he is assessing whether the latest allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against him "create too much of a cloud" for his Republican presidential candidacy to go forward.
That would mean that a Chicago talk-radio host who saw the two together at a tea party rally in Illinois this year is also lying...He needs voters to believe that Karen Kraushaar is a liar, too -- that she was so sensitive or so vindictive that she marched into the NRA's human resources department in 1999 to file a bogus sexual harassment complaint against Cain, then her boss...
White said she was never harassed or poorly treated by Cain, whom she described
Even before White went public with her allegations, Cain's support had fallen by more than half from an October Quinnipiac poll (30 percent) to a November Quinnipiac poll (14 percent).
A day after an Atlanta woman said she had a consensual affair with Cain, who is married, the candidate told supporters he is reassessing his campaign.
National Review first reported the news that Cain told a conference call with senior staff on Tuesday he would make a decision "over the next several days."
Stranger things have happened, as even Newt Gingrich -- probably the Republican candidate who stands to gain the most if Cain drops out of the race -- noted.
The return-to-roots strategy of the movie makes sense in that Cain's "9-9-9" plan is the most eye-catching part of his platform, and he has done best in the polls while focusing on that plan.
White also confirmed to CNN affiliate WSB that she had a sexual relationship with Cain, countering Cain's claims that the relationship was just a friendship "Absolutely," White said when asked by the affiliate if the relationship was sexual.
Gingrich could point to the fact that unlike Cain, his three marriages were never a secret; a statement unlikely to satisfy his critics.
What started the Cain ascent was Cain’s dissing of
unqualified Cain in response to charges of racism leveled at them.

Plakon questioned White’s credibility, saying the Atlanta woman lost a libel lawsuit earlier this year and has offered no specifics on her alleged affair with Cain other than dozens of text messages and telephone calls.
What's funny is, while you are bashing Clinton (or whomever) for their deeds, you are also bashing Cain who has all but admitted this affair.
