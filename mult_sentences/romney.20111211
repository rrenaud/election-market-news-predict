Mitt Romney Using Wife Ann Romney's Story To Connect With Voters
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich's trailing rivals derided the leading presidential contenders on Sunday as insufficiently conservative, each trying to find a second wind in the race to become the Republican nominee with time running out before voting begins.
Opposition to Romney is the one thing that unites Iowa's evangelicals, who question his backing of abortion rights and an individual healthcare mandate while he was governor of liberal Massachusetts.
When Perry suggested Romney backed an individual mandate for the nation – not just Massachusetts – in a book before changing the position in a later version, Romney challenged him to a $10,000 bet over whether Perry was telling the truth.
‘That's probably true," replied Romney, who lost that Senate contest.

Mr. Romney remains the front-runner in his New Hampshire backyard, but he is struggling to sustain his position here.
with you.  I mean, don’t Romney and Gingrich’s own words and actions count
On the issue at the center of last night’s exchange – whether Romney initially advocated that the individual mandate at the center of Massachusetts’ health care law was a model for the country – Perry did not back down.
He’s followed by Romney at 29 percent (a four-point decline), Paul at 8 percent and Perry at 4 percent.
"I think it was a very clarion moment in the debate," Perry said during the taping of Iowa Public Television's "Conversations with the Candidates" series slated to air tonight at 6:30 p.m. in talking about the much-discussed moment when Romney extended his right hand and asked the Texas governor if he'd wager $10,000 to settle a dispute over Romney's health-care record.
Now we're going back to the 1994 Senate race..."If I would have been able to get in the NFL like I wanted to as a kid I would have spent my life as a football player," Romney retorts, as he makes the argument about the need for a president with private-sector experience.
The abrupt shifts in strategy — which came on the eve of Saturday's critical debate in Des Moines — followed the release of polls showing Gingrich vaulting past Romney nationally and in key early states, including Iowa.
Despite the awful history and personality of Newt, true republicans don't want Romney since he's a Mormon.
And that debates in Iowa, much more than Romney's hamhanded reaction to his emergence so far, hold the key to his prospects.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has a newfound eagerness to talk to reporters some of them, at least.
Yet the race remains fluid, and the candidates are hoping to deflate Romney and Gingrich by noting similarities that could concern conservatives.
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — Attacked as a lifelong Washington insider, newly minted Republican front-runner Newt Gingrich parried criticism from Mitt Romney in campaign debate Saturday night, telling the former Massachusetts governor, "The only reason you didn't become a career politician is because you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994."
Ahead of debates, Romney's team rolled out new attacks on Perry - first hitting some of the Texas governor's comments on Social Security and then attacking him for his record on immigration.
In addition to discussing differences on capital gains, Romney also said “the real difference, I believe, is our backgrounds.
With Gingrich and Romney primed for a fight and Rick Perry, Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum ready to engage their rivals, buckle up for debate night in Des Moines.
Romney's campaign has spent most of the year focused on Obama instead of on his GOP rivals.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's campaign
While Mr. Romney still holds the lead, Mr. Gingrich tops the polls in Iowa, South Carolina and Florida, gaining enough steam that while here on Monday, he repeatedly referred to himself as the front-runner.
Romney warned against throwing “incendiary words into a place which is a boiling pot” -- and that doing so could make things harder for Israel.
“He really should be the politician in the family, not me,” Romney said.
Gingrich has a 23-point lead among these voters: 43 percent to Romney's 20 percent.
Rick Perry $10,000 on whether the governor had his facts right on a piece of Romney's record.
But the proximity of the Iowa caucuses — set for Jan. 3 — coupled with Gingrich’s past successes on the national stage have to be concerning for Romney and his team.
When pressed to name the issues on which he and Gingrich disagree, Romney jabbed the former House speaker’s ideas for space:
Gingrich's decision to invoke Kennedy, the late senator from Massachusetts, served as a dual reminder — that Romney has been running for office since the mid-1990s and also that he lost to the man whose politics conservatives detested above all others.
SIMON: Is that Romney's religion an issue with you?
Romney and Gingrich have called on Obama to fire the U.S. ambassador to Belgium, Howard Gutman, a Jew and the son of Holocaust survivors, after the diplomat said recently that some anti-Semitism stemmed from Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
Runner-up in the debate was, most observers agree, Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann, who fiercely attacked both Gingrich and Romney over their past support of the individual health-care mandate, their sometimes less-than-conservative records, and even coined a new buzz-worthy term that we hope won't stick: Newt Romney.

Here's TIME's take on a Romney line that his rivals are trying to make stick with him.
After Mitt Romney made fun of some of Newt Gingrich's more outlandish policy ideas, dredging up his proposal to place a permanent lunar colony on the moon, the former speaker of the House hit back, arguing the only reason Romney wasn't a career politician was because he couldn't win an election.
It was the perfect layup for Gingrich to deliver this shot at Romney, who lost his first bid for public office when he ran for U.S. Senate in 1994: “Let’s be candid, the only reason you didn’t become a career politician is you lost to Teddy Kennedy in 1994,” Gingrich said.
The lead has flipped repeatedly, from Mr. Romney to Mrs. Bachmann in July, to Mr. Perry in September, back to Mr. Romney for a brief moment in October, then to Mr. Cain and now to a surging Mr. Gingrich.
