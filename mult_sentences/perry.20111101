Thank you, Mr. Gleckman, for confirming my own take on the Perry tax plan.
I listened to Perry's worn out trickle down flat tax plan he's
Governor Rick Perry is a decent man who was elected to the governor’s office of the second largest state 3 times.
Perry, who took the stage first, called the Obama Administration "irresponsible" for not using domestic energy.
Perry's plan retains popular deductions within the flat tax, frees up more tax money (especiall­y among the wealthy) to invest in business ventures (which means jobs), and gives the taxpayer the option of continuing with the same tax code if they so choose.
"I'd hate to see a scenario in which a vibrant third choice in some way threw the 2012 election to a right-winger like a Rick Perry or a Michele Bachmann," he says.

At times nailing jokes with surprisingly deft comedic timing, but at other times veering off into tangents, Perry discusses his "Cut, balance and grow" platform, pushes his flat tax, and takes a jab at opponent Herman Cain.

So Rick Perry, Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich spoke on corporate tax policy in hopes of gaining an edge with economic conservatives two months before the Iowa caucuses.
Either Perry forgot his meds, or was under the influence of something here- this exceeds his normal exuberance­.
But it won’t be Perry.Never was going to be.And like the attention focused
Assuming the Cain story lingers (and it certainly seems like it is going to), that Bachmann can’t find a way back to relevance and that Romney stays off the Iowa and South Carolina airwaves, Perry can use the month of November to make his move.
The message Perry brought to the forum, which was organized by the University of Phoenix, a distance learning college, was not only about Washington, it was also about his rival for the Republican nomination, Mitt Romney, who he characterized as part of the “establishment.”
In the eight minute, 30 second clip, an unusually flamboyant Perry gesticulates and jokes while stumping before conservative activist group Cornerstone Action, in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.

Presidential candidate Rick Perry details his tax plan during a speech in Gray Court, S.C., last week.
Rick Perry fills out his papers to be on the New Hampshire's presidential primary ballot, Friday, Oct. 28, 2011.
For example, in 2015, the government would collect almost $1 trillion less in taxes under Perry's plan, a reduction of 27%.
Asked about federal benefits for ethanol and wind energy, which are both important in Iowa, most candidates agreed, as Mr. Perry said, that the federal government shouldn’t be “in the business of picking winners and losers” in the industry.
When Rick Perry jumped into the race, he was immediately hailed as the top not-Romney in the field, and his presumed broad appeal very quickly presented itself in the polls, where he shot to frontrunner status.
But the recent sexual-harassment controversy surrounding Cain, and the fact that Perry boasts the biggest campaign war chest among the Republican hopefuls, means the Texas governor still has the resources to back a rebound effort.
At least eight other Republicans, including Perry, have seen their standings soar in GOP primary surveys since the year began.
Mr. Perry has countered with an “analysis” by John Dunham, a former tobacco industry economist, that shows growth will explode under his plan.
Romney, in calling on Perry to denounce the comment, said, “I just don’t believe that that kind of divisiveness based on religion has a place in this country.” Huntsman called Jeffress a “moron,” and said “let’s stick to the big issues that really matter and leave religion off the table.”
Worst case scenario: That is Perry sober and every time we've seen him previously he's been hammered."

With Romney still unsure of whether — and how aggressively — to play in Iowa and South Carolina, it’s likely that Perry will have the airwaves largely to himself for the foreseeable future since none of the other candidates have the sort of campaign cash to begin advertising so early.

No matter which reality you subscribe to, Perry would generate the same amount of  money in 2015. TPC estimates the Perry tax code would collect $2.7 trillion, or 14.6 of Gross Domestic Product  assuming his plan is fully phased-in.

Perry's tax plan would be a flat tax of 20%, except that it would allow deductions for mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes.
“At today’s events in Iowa, Governor Perry probably won’t mention his support for tuition breaks for illegal immigrants at Texas colleges and universities, or the fact that he is promising job creation that would fail to even keep pace with population growth,” read an e-mail from Ryan Williams, a Romney spokesman.
