The new poll indicates that 8% support Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who's making his third run for the presidency, with Texas Gov.
But here we are, and now it is time to figure out which of these two uninspiring candidates to choose from - assuming we don’t see a late surge by former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania or Rep. Ron Paul of Texas.

Rick Perry, Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Buddy Roemer and Gary Johnson have solid pro-gun records, Rep. Ron Paul of Texas may be the most zealous pro-gun supporter.
Huntsman's spokesman, Tim Miller, mocked the event as "the 'Presidential Apprentice' Debate with The Donald," and Paul's campaign chairman, Jesse Benton, called the choice of Trump as a moderator "wildly inappropriate" and said his presence at the debate will "contribute to an unwanted circus-like atmosphere."
If someone singled out Ron Paul in an ad like this, and pointed out all of his quirks -- like being against pork and government spending but then requested millions of dollars for shrimp farms in his home district, or how he supports the state's ability to take away civil rights or abortion rights while maintaining he is the only candidate who believes in rights and freedom -- all the Paul supporters would cry foul and call it an "attack ad" and "media bias."
The gist: A fast-paced, animated spot with a Wild West motif anoints Paul as the "big dog" among candidates with bark but no bite.
