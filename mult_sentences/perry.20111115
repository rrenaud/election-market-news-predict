Quit letting them put you next to Perry on stage, Hermanator, it's rubbing off.
Mr. Perry cast himself as an “outsider” and suggested that, after spending his political career outside Washington, he is the best-equipped candidate in the GOP field to give Washington a makeover.
Rick Perry, shown campaigning in Iowa on Nov. 14, 2011, has raised concerns among pro-Israel officials for proposing a policy on foreign aid that would have recipients make their case every year.
Perry is notable for having extreme views in some cases while floundering towards apparent centrism in others.
Perry, who is trying to shake the ghost of an awkward debate gaffe last week, noted the Texas legislature only meets for 140 days every two years and said that members of Congress in Washington are "completely detached" from their constituents.
An Iowan running for Congress named Mike Batcher, who spent most of his talk rambling about his five kids and how he doesn't give prepared remarks, mocked Perry's inability during a debate last week to remember the third federal agency he wants to eliminate.
While offering no details of his government reform speech set for Tuesday morning at a Bettendorf manufacturing facility, Perry said he would address the lifelong appointments of federal judges, who he said aim to “arrogantly rewrite our laws from the bench”; upend the “permanent bureaucracy of the executive branch, which thwarts the will of the American people to advance a big government agenda”; and reform a Congress that “not only spends too much, but is in Washington too much.”
a noted conservative and one of Perry's earliest supporters.
Perry is proposing halving Congressional salary and turning members into part-time ‘Citizen Legislators' who hold jobs outside of government.
In the speech, Mr. Perry sought to present himself as a consummate Washington outsider.
To Perry's credit, he didn't deny his brain freeze.
In Washington, House Minority leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., questioned the seriousness of Perry's proposal and suggested he was pandering to tea party supporters.
Alas, Perry wasn't as amusing as he was comical when he appeared on the "Late Show with David Letterman."
Cain's experience, nonetheless, evoked thoughts of Perry's halting, forgetful statements in a recent debate when the Texas governor declared that he would immediately eliminate three agencies of government if elected, but could cite only two — the departments of Commerce and Education.
Rick Perry on Tuesday proposed slashing the salaries of "overpaid" congressional lawmakers by half, citing a Washington culture that has become increasingly "detached" from its constituents.
Rick Perry, who led nationally for several weeks, remains stagnant in Iowa.
Perry also called for a freeze on federal salaries until the budget is balanced and said he would also cut the president's pay in half until that goal is reached.
Then Michele Bachmann — after comically debating with Rick Perry about whether to "start foreign aid at zero" — went full Cheney with her line: "President Obama stands with Occupy Wall Street, but he doesn't stand with Israel."
Perry speaks of importance of Iowa voters in upcoming election
But there are a lot of voters who have yet to really tune in, and the Perry camp wants to introduce them to the rebooted version of Perry, stripped of the baggage that he's built up thus far.

Perry's proposal would threaten to make a bad situation even worse.
The Rick Perry moment was worse because of the stage on which it occurred,
But it's Perry's proposals to demote and reduce Congress that represent his most resonant attempt to claim the mantle of the mad-as-hell, anti-government candidate.

Twitter shows that nobody cared about what Perry had to say, although people did enjoy mocking Perry after each debate.
Perry focused much of his fire on President Obama, saying voters have grown weary of the president, but he was not shy about making the case that he would make a better rival than any of his Republican opponents, largely because he aggressively confronts Obama and offers the most dramatic change.
But Matt Whitaker, Perry's Iowa campaign co-chairman, said Perry has time to turn things around.
