Newt Gingrich And The 'Abnormal' Primary: His Class Of '94 Thinks Maybe He Could Win It
Today, Romney stands as the frontrunner for the GOP presidential nomination, the one candidate who has avoided the highs and lows that have plagued rivals such as Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and, now, Newt Gingrich.
And the professional; Gingrich is currently fending off reporters’ questions about his relationship with Freddie Mac.
Among the few who said they’re locked in, the choices named were Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.
Although Romney lost sizable support since last week's poll, 42 percent of Republicans still believe he will eventually win the nomination and go on to face President Barack Obama in next year's election, compared to 19 percent who think Gingrich will prevail in the Republican race.
In September 2002, Gingrich began planning for the new health-research center.
Democrats are hoping to help stretch the Republican nominating contest into a longer and bloodier battle between Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.
WASHINGTON -- Newt could prove to be a more satisfying flavor to Republican voters than conventional wisdom would suggest, say lawmakers who arrived on Capitol Hill in 1994, the year that Newt Gingrich engineered the GOP takeover of the House of Representatives and his own rise to speaker.

Gingrich is regarded by many, including Congressman Barney Frank, D-Mass., as a man "without a moral core," but that seems like a match made in heaven for a party whose morality doesn't sink in beyond the crust.
Democrats who won their seats in the '94 Republican revolution took a surprisingly similar view of Gingrich's chances.
"We did it for a number of companies, and Gingrich Group was very successful."
Instead, the institution that Gingrich inherited — the one in which Democrats worked with Republicans to pass the most important tax reform in modern history (Reagan's), and in which Republicans led Democrats to break a filibuster in the Senate and pass the most important social legislation in a century (The Civil
The campaign quoted Gingrich from an interview on Fox News calling the ad "probably the dumbest single thing I've ever done," but said the candidate believes conservatives "cannot be absent" from the debate about the environment.
Nor did Gingrich ever advocate against pending legislation affecting Freddie Mac, as some articles have incorrectly alleged."
But with the party's most conservative activists divided among Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum, polls have shown Romney in striking distance of a win.
