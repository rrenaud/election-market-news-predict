Jon Huntsman came off as perhaps the most reasonable of all the candidates, but at moments he seemed as if he were back working for Barack Obama as his ambassador, especially when he said America needs to withdraw from Afghanistan and nation build at home—a virtual echo of what the president has been saying.
The ad, however, overlooks the fact Huntsman holds positions to the left of his rivals; for instance, he supports civil unions for gay couples and believes humans have a role in climate change.
Appearing on CBS's "Face the Nation," Huntsman said there are areas that are critical to Washington, adding, in his words, "if they're in America's interest, we get some return on that invested dollar."
It is a good thing that the GOP/TP is not smart enough to look at Jon Huntsman.
Huntsman is a pure conservative in his positions on all major categories.

Jon Huntsman had a woman campaign manager until June, when she resigned.
Things got so obvious that, at one point in the debate, Huntsman was asked a question after a particularly long dry spell.
Also, I see this crop of GOP hopefuls -- save for Huntsman or Romney -- mirror the 2004 Democratic candidates: most are unfit for election, but because there is a perception that Obama is vulnerable, that somehow any mediocrity can beat him.
The Weekly Standard was dismayed in early September, when Jon Huntsman "sounded more like President Obama than the previous Republican president of the United States" -- and Rick Perry agreed with him.
For Huntsman, how much this super PAC can spend could well hold the key to whether he can be relevant in the race.
