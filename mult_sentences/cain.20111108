Herman Cain, visiting Capitol Hill, silent on latest harassment twist
Appearing on ABC's "Jimmy Kimmel Live," Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain says that he will fight the latest harassment allegations head-on because there is not an ounce of truth to the claims.
Cain unequivocally denied the harassment claims in the interview Monday night.
In New York on Monday, Bialek said Cain - an acquaintance - made a sexual advance in mid-July 1997, when she had travelled to Washington to have dinner with him in hopes he could help her find work or get her job back at the National Restaurant Association after she had been fired from a job in the group's education arm.
"Hello, Herman Cain here, with a message for the internet: You're way too complicated," Tyson says, before singing a little song about pizza.
"All allegations of harassment against Mr. Cain are completely false," it said in a statement.
It's not the first time that Cain has risen to the top of tea party tallies.
That would be a decided advantage in a general election race, where many independents may recoil from the aggressive Perry or Cain plans.
Of course Romney, in his quest for the Republican nomination would love to see Cain disappear and he will jump on the band wagon.
Cain agreed with Romney that the allegations are serious and disturbing, but he maintained they had no basis.
Cain responded to the charges at a news conference Tuesday afternoon in Phoenix.
Making the rounds of the morning talk shows, Sharon Bialek, a Chicago-area woman who once worked for the National Restaurant Assn.’s Educational Foundation, said she wanted to give Cain “a platform to come clean” about his alleged history of sexual harassment.
"I'm going to talk about it," Cain said, adding "we are taking this head on."
Though recent polling shows Cain still doing well, party operatives suggested
Cain said, as he did in an interview with ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Monday night, that his wife did not believe Bialek's claims.

“Instead of receiving the help that she had hoped for, Mr. Cain decided to provide her with his idea of a stimulus package,’’ Allred quipped to “Today.”
“After attacking Herman Cain through anonymous accusers for a week, his opponents have now convinced a woman with a long history of severe financial difficulties, including personal bankruptcy, to falsely accuse the Republican frontrunner of events occurring over a decade ago for which there is no record, nor even a complaint filed.”

Even as Cain readied his defense, his efforts to regain momentum were undercut Tuesday by another accuser -- Karen Kraushaar, a Treasury Department spokeswoman.
During a press conference in Scottsdale to address the scandal threatening to engulf his campaign, Cain repeated his claim that he did not recognize Bialek when he saw her at her press conference Monday and said he did not remember her name.
Bialek said she shared her allegations with her then-boyfriend and another male friend shortly after her meeting with Cain.

Cain told Kimmel that upon seeing the Bialek press conference, his wife said, "that doesn't even sound like you and I've known you for 45 years."

But the Cain statement suggests there are other motives at play.
Told that Cain has said his wife believes and supports him, Bialek responded: "I hope that's the case, but I have to believe that she's going through her own personal turmoil."
When Bialek went before cameras in New York on Monday, she became the first woman to publicly accuse Cain, and she offered a very detailed account of what she alleges transpired between the two.
"I don't believe that for a minute," said Debbie Dooley, a leader of the Atlanta Tea Party Patriots and a Cain supporter.
Bialek said earlier Tuesday that a reason she came forward with her account of Cain's alleged misbehavior 14 years after the fact was encouragement from her 13-year-old son.
At the news conference, Cain said the only complaint he could recall regarding Kraushaar involved a comment he made that she was about the same height as his wife, as he held his hand up to his chin.
In flatly denying any sort of knowledge of Bialek, Cain is taking a calculated risk.

WASHINGTON — A woman who settled a sexual harassment complaint against GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain in 1999 complained three years later at her next job about unfair treatment, saying she should be allowed to work from home after a serious car accident and accusing a manager of circulating a sexually charged email, The Associated Press has learned.
Cain, a Republican presidential candidate and the former head of the National Restaurant Association, said that the charges were "baseless" and "bogus."
On the one hand, Cain doubled down on his absolute denial of the charges; it seems impossible at this point that he could reverse course and make some Arnold Schwarzenegger-like admission of past “inappropriate” behavior.
This is not the same woman whose height Cain compared to his wife's, and it is unclear whether it is the woman whom Chris Wilson saw Cain harassing at a Crystal City restaurant.
Sharon Bialek claims she was groped by Cain after they had dinner together in 1997.
When asked about Kraushaar, Cain said he recalled her accusation of sexual harassment but insisted “it was found to be baseless.”
