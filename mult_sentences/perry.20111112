Perry and Obama both agree that the Palestinian UN bid is unproductive to the peace efforts—but the GOP contender takes it even further by calling for Washington to have “a very serious discussion” about defunding the international body.

A social and fiscal conservative, Perry has come under heavy fire from Republican rivals for relatively moderate immigration positions and an order that young girls in Texas be inoculated for a sexually transmitted virus.
He led in the early polls, had the support of some prominent Republicans, including Rick Perry, and was a favorite of the New York-based pundits.
The extent of any damage to the campaign will become more apparent with new polls and in Perry's ability to continue raising money.
Perry jumped to the front of the pack soon after his late entry into the race, but a RealClearPolitics average of national polls showed him behind Cain, Romney and Gingrich with just 10.2 percent.
Taken together, Cain and Perry's woes have Republicans wondering about yet another conservative alternative to Romney: former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
