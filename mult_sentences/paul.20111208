ST. PAUL — Republican presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann’s new book has been slow to move off of store shelves, according to figures from the first two weeks of sales.
His stumping for Romney comes as the former Massachusetts governor has fallen behind U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in recent polls and in advance of two Iowa debates that will feature the seven major Republican candidates seeking the nomination.
When Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman proved they still had a shred of human dignity by refusing to participate in Donald Trump's Very Classy GOP Presidential Primary Debate: The Debatening, they inspired the ever-confused Mitt Romney into staging his own mini insurrection by also refusing to attend.
Rick Santorum and Jon Huntsman are holding on as well, still waiting for their first turn in the spotlight, along with Paul, whose hard-line libertarianism has earned him a devoted following but makes him an unlikely candidate to catch on.
“He gave the liberals and the Democrats the ammunition they needed to moot, if you will, at least for the time being, Paul Ryan’s presentation.”
Based on states results in 2000, 2004 and 2008, and on states previous votes for third-party candidates, and on current polling about the strength of potential Republican nominees in particular states, it is plausible to think a Paul candidacy would have these consequences:
“The media says he can’t win” and 8-10T more debt – or – Ron Paul.
Contrary to the belief of the Ron Paul supporters, the media would absolutely love for either of these to take place -- or, indeed, any scenario which put Paul at the top of the ticket.
