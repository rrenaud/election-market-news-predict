Trump got seven minutes on the show even though he was on the phone, and used that time to hammer Huntsman, who has passed on participating in the Trump debate, as dishonest.
I've heard Huntsman criticized for being Obama's Amb to China, but Huntsman addresses this strongly and convincingly; that he loves this country and when your President asks you to serve you serve.
His spokesman added that Huntsman would skip the Dec. 27 debate moderated by Trump, preferring to stay home and watch it "with a big bowl of popcorn."
Huntsman also denied Trump’s claim that he called several times to schedule a meeting in hopes of getting Trump’s endorsement.
But those candidates are better than Huntsman at reflecting the mood of conservative voters: hyper-partisan, angry at Obama, and empowered by the sense that they represent the "real" America.
Jon Stewart's program pranked Huntsman by tweeting a question about "Mad Men" star Jon Hamm and intentionally linking the hashtag of Huntsman's online meeting.
Although it's doubtful Trump would actually make a run for the presidency, his announcement will undoubtedly strengthen both Huntsman's and Paul's reserve to stay away from the next debate.
