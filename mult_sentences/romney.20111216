REUTERS/Jim YoungMitt Romney and Newt Gingrich chatting at the conclusion of Thursday's debate.
The candidate I’ve been focused on is Rick Perry, since I still believe that he’s the only Republican with serious chance to defeat Mitt Romney.
Gingrich, whom Romney repeatedly called “zany” in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, preempted any repetition of that adjective this night by joking that on this evening “I’ve been concerned about not appearing to be zany.”
In reality, Romney tried to limit the impact of the ruling by ordering town clerks to enforce a little-known 1913 law to deny licenses to out-of-state couples and even testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of a federal marriage amendment.
Romney was governor of Massachusetts upon their legalization of gay marriage.

While Gingrich takes it easy, chief rival Mitt Romney will spend Saturday campaigning in South Carolina with Gov.

It is yet to be seen if Haley’s backing can help resurrect Romney in South Carolina, where former U.S. House speaker Newt Gingrich currently leads with Romney a distant second.
