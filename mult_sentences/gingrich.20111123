here Deal was an early backer of Gingrich's White House bid.
Gingrich was able to put a lot of the things that people despise about him to the side in favor of showing a more humble, compassionate and likeable persona.
He was referring to Romney’s comments at Tuesday night’s GOP candidate debate in which he criticized rival Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker, for proposing a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants who have been in the country for many years.
A course taught by Gingrich at two Georgia colleges was at the heart of the 1996 House Ethics Committee investigation of him that led to a $300,000 fine and House reprimand in January 1997 -- in part for using tax-exempt funds to underwrite a course that ethics investigators found had a partisan mission.

When Gingrich responded to Bachmann by saying he "specifically did not say we'd make the 11 million people legal," she turned it back on him.
The former House speaker called the law “a key part” of efforts to fight terrorism and said he “would look at strengthening it.” Gingrich outlined a scenario depicting a nuclear weapon in an American city.

Doing a turn on foreign policy in the 11^th GOP presidential debate Tuesday, Minnesota Republican Michele Bachmann accused President Obama of “handing over our interrogation of terrorists to the ACLU.” Bachmann later crossed swords with the latest front runner, Newt Gingrich, who suggested that some long-term illegal immigrants with strong ties to their communities should be allowed to stay in the United States.
The immediate question for Gingrich was, after boldly defending his position that illegal aliens who've lived in the U.S. for many years, establishing families and belonging to churches, should be allowed to remain in the U.S., would Gingrich now suffer the same fate as Texas Gov.

In a post-debate interview with CNN, Gingrich was already defending himself, saying if he was president millions of undocumented immigrants would still leave the country.

Gingrich also took a swipe at Romney, by sending a tweet to the former Massachusetts governor: “Here’s a trip down memory lane.” Gingrich’s tweet included a clip from a 2007 “Meet the Press” interview in which Romney said: “Those people who had come here illegally and are in this country, the 12 million or so that are here illegally, should be able to sign up for permanent residency or citizenship.”

Gingrich emphasized that the Patriot Act was “a key component” of the post-9/11 world, and warned that without it “we will be in danger for the rest of our lives.”
Gingrich didn’t seem to mind the response to his answers, as he stuck by them in a post debate interview with CNN’s Gloria Borger, who noted that it was a good thing to have a “program for legalization without citizenship for people who have been here a long time,” and added that he could not see a situation where people living long-term in America would be kicked out of their communities and churches without those communities protesting.
