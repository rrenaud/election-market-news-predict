Rick Perry Decks the Halls with Boughs of Homophobia
And if that's not enough, Perry viciously smears President Obama by falsely accusing him of waging a war on religion.
Since his infamous inability to remember the third of three government agencies he'd eliminate during the CNBC debate in Michigan last month, Perry's every verbal pratfall has offered the lead paragraph in news stories and the lead joke in late-night comedy shows.
Whether by political calculation or deference, Mr. Perry's designation of Mr. Williamson as the point man for this project helped him avoid repercussions at the polls.
Perry states his beliefs forcibly, such as his remark, "Social Security is a ponzi scheme."
At one point, Mr. Perry, taking a hard line against Mr. Gingrich for his three marriages, said, “If you will cheat on your wife, if you will cheat on your spouse, then why wouldn’t you cheat on your business partner.”
By now, it's no secret that debates aren't Rick Perry's strength.
Perry, for instance, was so beaten down by his opponents' attacks that he joked at a September debate in Tampa that he felt like "a pinata."
With religious conservatives consistently making up a large bloc of caucus voters every four years, can Perry also use the next two debates to appeal to them?

Which is probably why he agreed to sit for an interview appearing in next week's Newsweek magazine, where he speculates on when the Newtmentum began (the debate where he berated Fox News' Chris Wallace for "playing Mickey Mouse games"), describes Mitt Romney and Rick Perry "acting like seventh graders" in the debates, and tells Peter J. Boyer that just a few months ago, as his fund-raising slowed to a $167,000 trickle in July, he'd about had enough and made up his mind to exit the GOP field.
Conservatives like Perry use the Good Book selectively: compassion for corporations that want less regulations, don't pay their fair share of taxes nor living wages to their employees, while scorning those who don't fulfill their ideas of the ideal "Leave It to Beaver" heterosexual family setup.
