About Rick Perry 2012 Campaign for President– News and updates
Herman Cain is Mr. Magoo and Rick Perry can't stand him.
WASHINGTON — Herman Cain and Rick Perry were engaged in a war of words Thursday morning over the sexual harassment allegations of Cain that have rattled the presidential campaign.
A Perry spokesperson says, it was quote "patently untrue" that the Perry campaign had any role in placing the sexual harassment story with Politico.
Perry has the money to get another twirl around the dance floor, although it’s going to take a fortune in 30-second TV ads to make Republicans forget that he can’t form simple declarative sentences in debates and is insufficiently hostile to immigrants.
The ad features Perry in a blue button-down shirt as he describes himself as ‘a doer not a talker.’ Perry started his advertising push in Iowa last week, with the release of the first TV spot touting his job creation record last Wednesday and the ‘Doer’ ad began airing on Monday.” http: //abcn.ws/vch7w2

Herman Cain and Rick Perry were engaged in a war...
Not hard to guess: Andrea Saul of the Mitt Romney campaign twitters this morning that Brown and Perry “shared liberal immigration policies.” So looks like Romney’s camp is targeting, not Herman Cain, but the Texas Governor as the big threat, the guy who is “supplying bad ideas to California since 2001.” Ouch.
Perry, who has proposed a 20 percent flat tax, said Romney’s plan was wrongly based on preserving much of the current tax system.
While other Republican presidential candidates have kept their distance on the issue, Perry deeply waded into the topic in an interview published over the weekend in Parade magazine.
Trump's flirtation with the Republican hopefuls-- Rick Perry's fun with birtherism, Michele Bachmann's tele-townhall, and now assuming the mantle of Herman Cain's premier defender--seems like he's more interested in the ratings that their debates have snagged and their current celebrity status than their actual causes or their chances of winning the nomination.
