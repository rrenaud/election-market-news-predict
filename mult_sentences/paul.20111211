THE CANDIDATE’S DAY: Paul started Friday, the second day of a three-day campaign swing, in Webster City.
Meanwhile, Ron Paul has fought for the American people for 30 years, advocating sound monetary policies, ending the Wars, Auditing the Fed, ending the multi-billion dollar Drug War and repealing the Patriot Act.
Many of Paul's backers rightly believe that the media continue to minimize his campaign even though he's running second to Gingrich in the Iowa polls and is ahead of his fellow Texan, Gov.
Ron Paul is the most conservative of the candidates because abiding by the Constitution of the United States is all about being conservative.
At the center of the storm is newly minted front-runner Newt Gingrich, while the once-anointed Mitt Romney throws punches, Texas Congressman Ron Paul accuses him of hypocrisy and back-of-the-pack hopefuls like Texas Gov.
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas criticized Gingrich for supporting the federal bailout of the nation's financial sector, taking consulting fees from Freddie Mac and for taking multiple positions "on so many issues."

RON PAUL Is he able to pull off a debate performance where he doesn’t insult non-libertarian-leaning Republicans?
Ron Paul is not advocating anything like successionism, what he is talking about is the constitutionally mandated ideal that whatever is not mandated to the government or prohibited specifically by the constitution is the RESPONSIBILITY of the states.
Each of the other four candidates on the stage -- Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Ron Paul and Rick Perry -- scored points.
South Carolina and Florida are more problematic but as you go forward and the media are forced to admit that Paul is a legitimate candidate we could see a real battle for the hearts and minds of the American people.
Based on states' results in 2000, 2004 and 2008 -- and on states' previous votes for third-party candidates -- and on current polling about the strength of potential Republican nominees in particular states, it is plausible to conclude that a Paul candidacy would have these consequences:
Paul will nearly sweep the independent vote which is constantly rising in numbers, and even a sizable share of democrats will vote for him.

A recent New York Times-CBS poll showed 70 percent of likely caucus-goers had heard from Paul's campaign in some way.
Recent polls have shown him lagging badly behind Mr. Romney, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.
A strong impression in the next two debates could be good timing for Paul, who is in double digits in Iowa and New Hampshire polls behind Gingrich and Romney.
At a minimum, a Paul candidacy would force the Republican nominee to spend time and money in places he otherwise might be able to economize both.

“These aren’t extreme views, these are rather moderate views,” Paul said.

They are pretty good.  I think we have seen it.  This is the final two.  When they're one-on-one debates or even if it's the three of them, Ron Paul shows that he can give as well as he can take.  It's going to be an interesting, long primary campaign if it, indeed, goes long.  But I tell you, obviously, what we're seeing in the polls, it's instructive that Newt Gingrich brought up 1994 because that is his key strength, and it is Romney's key weakness.

A similar scene plays out most days and nights in the Nevada offices of U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, the only other GOP candidate as organized as Romney eight weeks before the caucuses.
