As for the candidates who have placed much emphasis on Iowa but have failed to break into the top tier in the Iowa polls, like Rep. Michele Bachmann of neighboring Minnesota and Rick Santorum, the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, Branstad said he wasn't writing them off.
The paper wraps the “closing arguments” from the debate and includes a quote from Craig Robinson (@IowaGOPer): Bachmann was aggressive, I know everyone’s talking about that, but I think we have to wonder is she doing the job of knocking people down – I think she’s doing a really good job of that – but is she building herself up?” said Craig Robinson, editor of the Iowa Republican news site, who watched at the downtown Sioux City Convention Center Thursday night.
In the first hour of the GOP debate in Iowa, Newt Gingrich and Michele Bachmann went toe to toe over Gingrich's $1.6 million in earnings as a consultant to Freddie Mac.
This week Michele Bachmann teed up the easiest entry that Politifact has ever posted in its life.
Gingrich asserted that Bachmann had it wrong – that his policy is to break up both Freddie Mac and its sister institution, Fannie Mae.
He pushed back at Bachmann's claim that Freddie Mac is a "grandiose scam" that needs to be shut down, saying her allegations about his relationship with Freddie Mac were "factually untrue."

During an exchange with Newt Gingrich over his past work at the government-sponsored mortgage company Freddie Mac, Bachmann insisted that she was right in asserting Gingrich had worked to lobby lawmakers on Freddie Mac's behalf.
On Bachmann calling for stronger U.S. action against Iran:
During Thursday’s debate in Iowa, Representative Michelle Bachmann took issue: “The speaker had his hand out and he was taking $1.6 million to influence senior Republicans to keep the scam going.
Gingrich did not get a chance, however, to counter the statements made by Nahigian and Stewart, who closed their meeting in the "spin room" by reiterating Bachmann's favorite line, claiming she is the only "consistent conservative" in the GOP race.
Kara Harthoorn, a high school student from Unity Christian High School, said she was excited to vote for the first time in the coming elections, but wasn’t sure Bachmann would be her candidate.
Moments later, Bachmann challenged Paul even more aggressively, saying his views on Iran were a danger given the country’s work on acquiring a nuclear weapon.
When Michele Bachmann said in last night's presidential debate, "After the debates that we had last week, PolitiFact came out and said that everything that I said was true," you just had to know PolitiFact would want to weigh in.
Bachmann's goal is to make appearances in all 99 Iowa counties prior to the caucuses.
Democrats, on the other hand, see Romney as the most likely nominee (21 percent) with Gingrich second (16 percent), and Bachmann third (12 percent).
Scarborough’s guest, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele, seemed to agree, praising Bachmann for standing up to Gingrich.
But we all have limits, and Bachmann hit hers in Thursday’s GOP presidential debate, when her rival Newt Gingrich sneered – and you really have to watch this to get the full effect -- “Sometimes Congressman Bachmann doesn’t get her facts very accurate.’’
