Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich at the head of the pack—sustain momentum in the battle to pick a 2012 election challenger for Obama.
It's certainly possible to shatter his composure -- the one time that Gingrich has been attacked in a debate, when Mitt Romney needled him for having supported a health-care mandate in the 1990s, he got testy and defensive, and ended up ceding the point.
At the same time, Romney's positive intensity has dwindled from +15 to +11 and Cain's has tumbled from +34 to +14.
“Actually, Newt, we got the idea of an individual mandate from you,” Mr. Romney said after Mr. Gingrich called the health care plan Mr. Romney signed in Massachusetts a “big-government, bureaucratic, high-cost system.”
But the flip side is that the argument the Romney campaign is trying to make is not extremely simple.

I’m pretty much Independent and would love to see a viable candidate, but Romney is doing his best to lose me … And other independents.
